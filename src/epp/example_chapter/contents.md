## To Do

```{todo}
Setup
- Copy and paste `./scr/epp/chapter_template`, and rename according to `CHAPTER_NAMES` in `src/epp/config.py`.

Contents
- Fill the existing .md and .ipynb files and/or add new ones.
    - names of .ipynb files must **not** contain hyphens (correct: `in_class_exercise.ipynb`, incorrect: `in-class-exercise.ipynb`)
    - Do not change the level of headers (exactly *one* level 1 header, no jumps from 1 to 3, etc.).
    - Copy-paste paper-pdf into new folder.

Screencasts
- Rename `screencast_template`-folder (one folder per screencast).
- Edit `slides.md` and edit/delete `script.md`.
- In `task_create_screencast.py` find and delete all `skipif`s (`@pytask.mark.skipif`) / Copy `task_create_screencast.py` from `introduction` folder.
- Upload screencasts to `educast.nrw` and link them in `preparation.md`.

Config book
- Edit `config.py` in current chapter folder (screencast slides named after screencast folder; do not forget script.md).
- If not yet done, append folder name to `CHAPTER_NAMES` in `src/epp/config.py`.
- Specify materials to include in the book in `MOST_RECENT_MATERIALS` in `src/epp/config.py`.

Test
- Run `pytask`.
