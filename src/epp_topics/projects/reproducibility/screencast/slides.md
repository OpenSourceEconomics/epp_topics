# Availability

- Source data:
  - Always start from the data in the way you obtained it
  - Add a detailed description how you got it
  - If possible, include all datasets in a common format
- Source code:
  - Include any code that is needed to produce your results
- Programmes:
  - Document all programmes that need to be installed to run your code
  - Automate the installation as much as possible with environments
  - When the project reaches a milestone (submission?), pin the versions
- Essentially a version of
  [https://datacodestandard.org/](https://datacodestandard.org/)

---

# Version control

- Raw data and source code are under version control
- Published results are created from the main branch with no uncommitted changes
- Use tags / releases to mark submissions, revisions, etc.

---

# Separation of source files and output

- All generated files are in a separate folder that can be safely deleted
- Generated files are not under version control!
  - Can easily become outdated
  - GitHub repository size would explode
  - Does not help with reproducibility
- Intermediate data could be added upon final publication

---

# Theory / Automation

- The workflow can be described by a directed acyclic graph
  - Files are nodes
  - Tasks operating on these files are nodes
  - Edges describe the dependencies
- There is one command that converts your source data into the paper with
  figures and tables


---

# Documentation and readability

- You strive for readability in your source code
- There is a README file that documents
  - Your directory structure
  - How to install packages
  - How to run your code
- Docstrings and comments explain the code where necessary
