# Motivation

- Pytask is a powerful package
- We have only seen basics in the course
- Examples of advanced features are:
  - Repeating the same task with different inputs
  - Execute your project in parallel
  - Command line options
  - ...
- You can learn those from the [documentation](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
