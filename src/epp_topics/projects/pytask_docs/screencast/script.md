# Script: Pytask documentation

Most of this will be a live demo browsing the documentation

## Motivation

- Mention that it is more generally an important skill to understand the documentation
  of python packages
- Mention an example where each point is helpful
  - Repeating tasks: Cleaning datasets of multiple waves in a panel
  - Execute in parallel: Faster runtime without having to know how to parallelize things
  - Command line options: Draw the dag, execute a specific task, ...

## Switch to live demo:

https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Maybe mention quickly in the screencast that at the time of recording we need the
"latest"
