# Terminology

- **Cookiecutter**: A Python library that helps you customise a project to your needs
- **Pytask**: A build system that executes the different steps of your research
project, keep track of dependencies between steps, and only execute what needs to be
executed. It can execute independent tasks in parallel.
- **Project templates**: An example project implementing best practices and a
recommended directory structure for pytask projects
