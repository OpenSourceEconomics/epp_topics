# What are the project templates

- An example of a empirical project that helps you learn pytask
    - All best practices are implemented
    - Convenient approach to handling file paths
- A recommended directory structure you can customize
    - Folders for the typical steps in a research project
    - Clear separation of source files and results
- A convenient way of starting your own project
    - Cookiecutter guides you through the setup

# Terminology

- **Cookiecutter**: A python library that guides you through the setup of your project
- **Pytask**: A build system that executes the different steps of your research
project, keep track of dependencies between steps, and only execute what needs to be
executed. It can execute independent tasks in parallel.
- **Project templates**: An example project implementing best practices and a
recommended directory structure for pytask projects
