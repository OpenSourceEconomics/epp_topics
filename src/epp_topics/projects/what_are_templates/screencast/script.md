# Script: What are the templates?

This will be a very short screencast to clear up some misunderstandings from previous
years

## What are the project templates

- Do not talk about the specifics of the example or directory structure yet. All of that

## Terminology

The misunderstandings I found most annoying is that people used the terms pytask and
project templates as synonyms. Things like:

> I converted my notebook to the templates but it doesn't work ...

Did the person mean:

- Conversion of a notebook to a Python script
- Starting the commands from pytask?
- Inserting the notebook into the project template?
