# Script: Directory Structure

## Guiding principles

Make examples why each principle is important

1. We discussed it in reproducibility
1. Helps to quickly find your way in a new project
1. Mention an example where the separation is important, e.g. changing the color of a
   plot would trigger a 12 hour skillmodels estimation. Say that waiting 2 minutes often
   enough can also completely destroy your productivity

## Switch to file explorer

### go to project root

- Say that all the helper files might look complicated but can mostly be ignored

### go to src

- Show them the analysis steps
- Click on analysis as one example. Show the different py files and the task file

### go to bld/python

- Show as an example that latex tables have been generated automatically and remind them
  that we require that for reproducibility
