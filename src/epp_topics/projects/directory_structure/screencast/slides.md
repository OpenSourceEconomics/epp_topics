# Guiding principles

- Clear separation of inputs and outputs
  - need separate `src` and `bld` folder
- Group files in directories by step of the analysis
  - need `data_management`, `analysis`, `model_specs`, `final` inside `src`
- Separation of long-running analysis tasks from fast visualizations
  - need to separate `analysis` and `final`
