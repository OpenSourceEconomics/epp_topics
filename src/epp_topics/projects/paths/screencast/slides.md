### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

<br>

# Reproducible Research


### Path handling in projects

<br>


Jano≈õ Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# Recap: Path goals


- Start paths relative to the root folder of the project
- Only make assumptions about directory structure inside the project
- Define the path in a way that is portable across operating systems

We showed you how to do this in the pathlib screencast, but in the project templates
there is a simpler way

# How to use it

<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

assume your project slug is `my_project`

```python
from my_project.config import SRC, BLD


def task_clean_data(
    raw_data=SRC / "original_data" / "data.csv",
    produces=BLD / "data" / "clean_data.pkl",
):
    ...
```

</div>
<div>

- `SRC`, `BLD` and some other paths are defined inside `config.py`
- Can be imported from anywhere in the project
- Only works inside the project environment

</div>
</div>

# How it is implemented

<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

in config.py

```python
from pathlib import Path

SRC = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
BLD = SRC.joinpath("..", "..", "bld").resolve()

TEST_DIR = SRC.joinpath("..", "..", "tests").resolve()
PAPER_DIR = SRC.joinpath("..", "..", "paper").resolve()
```

</div>
<div>

- You can define more shorthands if you need them
- Makes it easy to rename entire folders in one central place

</div>
</div>
