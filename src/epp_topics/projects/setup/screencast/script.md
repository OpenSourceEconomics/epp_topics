# Script: Setting up a project

There are no slides, just live demo

## Motivation (show title slide)

Give a brief motivation what the templates help to do:

- Use the project name (slug) for folder names, etc.

## Where to get help (show docs)

[Customising the template for your needs](https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/stable/customising-the-template/)

## Create a github repogetting_started/index.html#customising-the-template-for-your-needs

- Go to https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates
- Click on "Use this template"+
- Call it `musical_fiesta` (suggested at some previous point, just to be consistent
  across screencasts)
- Copy the URL

## Clone the repo (show terminal)

- git clone ...
- code musical_fiesta

## Do the setup (show VS code)

- Important to rename the project slug first
- Then follow
- Do show connection to git repo

## Verify the setup (show file explorer)

- Run pytask and show that it finds tasks
- Do not discuss directory structure yet
