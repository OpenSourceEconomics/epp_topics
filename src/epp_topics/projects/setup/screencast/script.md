# Script: Setting up projects

There are no slides, just live demo

## Motivation (show title slide)

Give a brief motivation what cookiecutter helps to do:

- Select the correct version of the example
- Configure the settings according to taste (e.g. license, ...)
- Use the project name (slug) for folder names, etc.

## Install cookiecutter

We forgot to put cookiecutter in the environment, so we will have to install it.

For speed reasons I think a pip install into the base env would be ok

## Where to get help (show docs)

[Documentation of the cookiecutter dialogue](https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/index.html#customising-the-template-for-your-needs)

## Do the setup (show shell)

- no pre-commits yet!
- Do show connection to git repo

## Verify the setup (show file explorer)

- Show the project folder named like their project slug
- Run pytask and show that it finds tasks
- Do not discuss directory structure yet
