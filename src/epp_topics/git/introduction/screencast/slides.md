### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

<br>

# Version Control and collaboration with Git and Github

### Introduction and Overview

<br>

JanoÅ› Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# What is git

- Definition: A distributed version control system
- Practical: Something that lets you ...
    - ... go back in time
    - ... keep track of different versions of your code
    - ... try out changes without fear of breaking anything
    - ... document your project in a commit history

---

# What is GitHub

- Definition: GitHub is a platform and cloud-based service for software development
  and version control using Git
- Practical: Something that lets you
    - ... collaborate efficiently with coauthors
    - ... review changes to your code before accepting them
    - ... manage coding and research projects via issues and pull requests
    - ... build a portfolio for a highly payed tech job

# Why researchers need git and GitHub

- Most papers are written by groups
- Empirical and computational projects become more complex
- The publication process entails multiple rounds of revisions
- Reproducibility and transparency are key

# The learning journey

To quote John von Neumann:

> Young man, in ~~mathematics~~ **git** you don't understand things. You just get used to them.

<br/>

- Learning git is a long journey
- Payoffs are enormous and once you learned it you will not want to go back!
- The best way to learn it is:
  - Learn git on your local computer first
  - Only use the shell!
  - Practice, practice, practice!
- Don't be afraid of an ugly and convoluted commit history, we won't deduct anything for that

# Notes about the video series

- We will use an existing video series to learn git
- Examples are from web development
  - Works the same for any other plain text file
- A few things have changed since they were recorded
  - `master` has been renamed to `main`
  - The Atom editor has been replaced by VS Code
  - On Windows, the Powershell has seen improvements, so forget about commander
