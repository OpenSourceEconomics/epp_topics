# Cloning GitHub repos + Personal Access Tokens

## Objectives

After reading through this page you will be able to ...

- Clone repositories from GitHub
- Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Save the PAT so you do not have to type your password anymore

## What is cloning?

Cloning a repositorie means downloading a repository from GitHub. The cloned repository
is linked to the online repository and can be easily synchronized via commands you will
see later.

Cloning is very simple and can be done in a one-line shell command.

**Except for the very first time, where you have to create and store a personal access
token.**

## How it will work later

First you go to the github page of the repository you want to clone and copy the linke
for cloning via HTTPS.

Then you type:

```bash
git clone YOUR_LINK
```

After pressing enter, the repository will be downloaded to your current working
directory.

## How it works the first time

When executing the clone command (1), you will be prompted to enter your user name and
password (2). Even if you enter both correctly, you will get an error message (3).

This is because you have no PAT yet

To create the PAT, got to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), click onn the
hamburger menu (1) and then on settings (2).

Scroll down and klick on "Developer settings"

Click on the following things:

1. Personal access tokens to expand the menu
1. Tokens (classic)
1. Generate new token
1. Generate new token (classic)

Now you have to pick settings

1. A name for your personal access token. Choose whatever you want
1. An expiration date. It is recommended to use a short one (for security reasons) but
   you decide how often you want to create a new token.
1. Check the "repo" checkbox and no other checkboxes

Scroll all the way down and click on "Generate token"

Copy the token and save it somewhere you will find it again. Do not post screenshots of
the token on the internet, this is like a password. I deleted the token you see on the
srceenshot before posting it.

Go back to your shell and do the following:

1. Type `git config --global credential.helper store` and press enter. This will
   seemingly not do anything but it says that the next entered password or token will be
   saved.
1. Clone
1. Type in your username
1. **Instead of a password, paste your PAT**

To make sure that the token was saved and you can from now on clone without entering
your token, you can delete the repo you just cloned (1) and clone again. It should look
as follows:
