# Dictionaries

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> a = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
>>> type(a)
<class 'dict'>


>>> a["b"]
2

>>> a["c"] = 42
>>> a
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 42}

>>>a["d"] = 4
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 42, 'd': 4}
```

</div>
<div>

- Map a set of keys to a set of values
- Creation by curly braces and `:` to separate keys and values
- **mutable**: Can add or overwrite entries
- Order is preserved *(since Python 3.6)*


</div>

# Fun facts about dicts in Python

- Dicts are the absolute workhorse datastructure
- Everything is an object and every object is just a dictionary under the hood!
- Highly optimized for fast lookup!


---

# What can go in a dict?


<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> nested = {
>>>   1: {"bla": "blubb"},
>>>   "two": {"foo": "bar"},
>>> }
```

</div>
<div>

- Keys need to be hashable, for example
  - strings
  - ints
  - tuples thereof
- Values can be absolutely anything
- If values are dicts we get nested dictionaries

</div>
</div>

# Accessing elements

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> flat = {"bla": "blubb"}
>>> nested = {
>>>   1: flat,
      "two": {"foo": "bar"}
>>> }

>>> flat["bla"]
'blubb'

>>> nested[1]
{'bla': 'blubb'}

>>> nested[1]["bla"]
'blubb'

```

</div>
<div>

- Elements are accessed with square brackets
- Chained access for nested dictionaries



</div>
</div>

# Careful with mutability

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> flat = {"bla": "blubb"}
>>> nested = {
>>>   1: flat,
      "two": {"foo": "bar"}
>>> }


>>> nested[1]["bla"] = 42
>>> flat
{'bla': 42}
```

</div>
<div>

- Putting a dictionary inside another dictionary does not make a copy
- Useful to save memory, dangerous if you don't know about it
- We will cover ways to deal with this later


</div>
</div>

# When to use dictionaries

- Dictionaries provide label based access
- Lists provide position based access
- Label based access is more readable and less error prone!
- Example use-cases:
  - Storing model specifications
  - Storing results of your anlysis
  - ...
