# Script: Comprehensions

There are two main messages here:

- Comprehensions are only more readable if they fit on one line
- They might be a few percent faster but won't save you if you need speed!

## Common loop patterns

- We have discussed these before in the looping section

## When to use

- Can also mention that lists and dicts themeselves are not good containers if you want
  to do calculations with thousands or millions of numbers
