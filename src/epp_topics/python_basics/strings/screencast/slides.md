# Assigning strings

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> a = "Hello"
>>> type(a)
str

>>> b = 'embed "double" quotes'
>>> c = "embed 'single' quotes"

>>> not_an_int = "123"
>>> type(not_an_int)
str

>>> not_an_int * 2
'123123'
```

</div>
<div>

- Strings can hold arbitrary text data
- Defined with single or double quotes
- Strings containing numbers do not behave like numbers!

# Everything is an object == Everything has methods

- Any language has `int`, `float`, `bool` and `string`
- C, Fortran, ...:
  - low level types to store data efficiently and do fast calculations
- Python: Everything is an object
  - Objects with convenient methods
  - Trade efficiency for convenience
  - We can still get efficient when needed!

# Some string methods


<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> a = "Hello World!"
>>> a.lower()
'hello world!'

>>> a.replace("!", ".")
"Hello World."

>>> a.startswith("Hello")
True
```

</div>
<div>

- There are many methods for string manipulation
- [Full documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)

# String formatting


<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> a = "Hello"
>>> b = "3"
>>> f"{a} {b}"
'Hello 3'

>>> c = 3.145
>>> f"{a} {c}"
'Hello 3.145'

```

</div>
<div>

- "f-strings" allow you to puzzle together different strings
- Variables used in formatting are automatically converted to strings
- Many useful applications:
  - Embed results of calculations in messages
  - Write good error messages
  - Format numbers in tables

</div>
</div>

# Strings are a sequence type


<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> a = "Hello World!"
>>> len(a)
12

>>> a[0]
'H'

>>> a[1]
'e'

>>> a[-1]
'!'
```

</div>

- Most of the time, you can think of strings as scalar variables
- They are actually sequences of characters
    - Have a length
    - Can be indexed
    - *Can be sliced*
    - *Can be iterated over*
- Indexing starts at 0
- Negative indices start from the end
