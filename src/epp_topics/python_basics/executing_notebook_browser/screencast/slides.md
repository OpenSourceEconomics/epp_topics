# Preparation

- We assume you have installed anaconda and created the course environment
- Open a shell in the root directory of your project
    - On Windows, use the anaconda prompt or the powershell
    - If conda is not recognized in the powershell, check out this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65160772/21900143)
- Activate the environment using `conda activate epp`
- Confirm the activation worked using `conda info`

# Example project structure


```bash
epp_project/
  exercises/
    exercise_1.py
    exercise_2.ipynb

  datasets/
    data.csv
```

- Our shell is in the `epp_project` directory
- We want to run `exercise_2.ipynb` in the browser
- Command is `jupyter notebook`
