# Script: Lists, Tuples and Sets

- We index into lists and tuples on the slides where they are introduced. Don't talk
  about it too much yet. Details on indexing are on a later slide
- I don't mention nested lists or tuples on purpose; Would probably introduce that once
  very briefly when we talk about numpy arrays.
