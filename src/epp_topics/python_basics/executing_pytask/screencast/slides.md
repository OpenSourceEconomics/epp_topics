# Preparation

- We assume you have installed anaconda and created the course environment
- Open a shell in the root directory of your project
    - On Windows, use the anaconda prompt or the powershell
    - If conda is not recognized in the powershell, check out this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65160772/21900143)
- Activate the environment using `conda activate epp`
- Confirm the activation worked using `conda info`

# How does pytask execute code

- Executing .py files: Run the entire file
- Executing notebooks: Run individual cells
- Pytask: Run individual functions in multiple .py files

Very useful for automating research pipelines
