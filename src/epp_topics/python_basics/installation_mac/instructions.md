# Installing Python on Linux

There are many different ways to install the Python language and Python packages. Below
we provide one way that works well for everything we need in the class. Please stick
exactly to the instructions unless you know what you are doing and are absolutely sure
you will never need any help from us.

If you have previously installed Python in a different way you can either keep your
installation (if you know what you are doing) or uninstall it and do a fresh install
according to the instructions.

We will cover the following topics:

1. How to install **mamba**: Mamba is a fast package manager that will install the
   everything else. We install it via miniforge.
1. How to create the **course environment**: The course environment is a collection of
   Python packages that we will need for the course.
