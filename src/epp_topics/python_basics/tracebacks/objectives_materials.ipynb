    "\n",
    "- Read Python tracebacks and focus on the important parts\n",
    "    - What type of error\n",
    "    - Where did it happen\n",
    "    - What exactly happened\n",
    "- Describe an error precisely in your own words\n",
    "- Ask your fellow students and instructors for help\n",
