### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

<br/>

# Basic Python

### Importing, Namespaces, Modules

<br/>


Jano≈õ Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# Contents

- What are libraries?
- Different ways to import libraries or parts of libraries
- Namespaces
- Modules
- Typical errors when importing


---

# Third party libraries

- Python is a general purpose programming language
- The base language you have seen so far is extended by libraries
  - Standard library (e.g. pathlib, functools)
  - Third party libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, scipy)
- Libraries need to be imported to use them
- Third party libraries need to be installed


---

# The example

- We will use the numpy library as example
- Numpy provides efficient data structures and functions for working with n-dimensional
  arrays
- Feel free to watch the numpy screencast for details but otherwise just ignore any
  numpy-specific details for now

# Different ways to import

<div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-4">
<div class="col-span-3">

```python
# Import one function / object
from numpy import array

# Import an entire library
import numpy

# Import entire library and rename it
import numpy as np

# Import everything from a library
from numpy import *
```

</div>
<div class="col-span-2">

- Use single import if you need one-three specific things
- Use library import if you need many functions
- Use shorthand if there is a convention, e.g. numpy (np), pandas (pd), seaborn (sns)
- Never ever use `import *`

</div>
</div>

# Namespaces *(why not to use "import \*")*


<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
# bad option
>>> from math import log
>>> log(2.718281828459045)
1.0

# better option
>>> import math
>>> math.log(2.718281828459045)
1.0

>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.log(2.718281828459045)
1.0
```

</div>
<div>

- Multiple libraries could implement `log`
  - math library: The natural logarithm
  - web development library: Write a log file
- Importing an entire library makes it very explicit from which namespace you use a
  function
- Namespaces are one of the reasons why Python has succeeded in so many different areas!

</div>
</div>

# Modules

- So far we imported from the standard library or from packages
- You can import from any module (a module is a `.py` file)
- In larger projects you will split code across multiple modules and import them
- Think of a package as a structured collection of modules

---

# ModuleNotFoundError

```python
>>> from numpai import array
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ModuleNotFoundError                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[32], line 1
----> 1 from nampai import array

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nampai'
```

- Meaning: The library you asked for is not found
- Do you have a typo in the library name?
- Is the library installed in your environment?
- **Is the correct environment activated?**

<br/>

---

# ImportError

```python
from numpy import arrrrray
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[33], line 1
----> 1 from numpy import arrrrray

ImportError: cannot import name 'arrrrray' from 'numpy'
(/home/user_1/mambaforge/envs/epp_topics/lib/python3.11/
   site-packages/numpy/__init__.py)
```

<br/>

- Something went wrong during import
- Do you have typos in what you want to import?
- Is the correct version of the library installed?
