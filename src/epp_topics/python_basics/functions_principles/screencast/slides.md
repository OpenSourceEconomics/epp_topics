# Basic Python

### Principles for Good Functions

- Why functions are important!
- Guidelines for self-contained functions
  - Pass all variables you want to use inside
  - Do not modify mutable arguments

# Why functions are important

- Help to re-use code and avoid duplication
- Help to structure code and reduce cognitive load
- Make individual code snippets testable
- Help to make your projects more reproducible
- Unlock the power of functional programming concepts
- Are also the basis for good object oriented code

# Pass all variables you want to use inside

<div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-4">
<div class="col-span-3">

```python
# bad example
>>> global_msg = "Hello {}!"

>>> def greet_with_global(name):
...     print(global_msg.format(name))

>>> greet_with_global("Guido")
Hello Guido!
```

</div>
<div class="col-span-2">

- Inside a function you have access to variables in the enclosing scope
- This is dangerous because the behaviour of the function now depends on global
  variables
- Do not use this in your code!


</div>

# Pass all variables you want to use inside

<div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-4">
<div class="col-span-3">

```python
# solution 1: define inside function
>>> def greet(name):
...     msg = "Hello {}!
...     print(msg.format(name))
>>> greet("Guido")
Hello Guido!

# solution 2: pass as argument
>>> def greet_explicit(name, msg):
...     print(msg.format(name))

>>> greet_explicit("Guido", "Hello {}!")
Hello Guido!
```

# Do not modify mutable arguments

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> def append_4(some_list):
...     some_list.append(4)
...     return some_list

>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> append_4(a)
[1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]

# better solution
>>> def append_4(some_list)
...     out = some_list.copy()
...     out.append(4)
...     return out
```

</div>
<div>

- Arguments are passed by reference, i.e. without making a copy
- Make sure that functions do not modify mutable arguments!
    - Make copies
    - Avoid changing objects in the first place
