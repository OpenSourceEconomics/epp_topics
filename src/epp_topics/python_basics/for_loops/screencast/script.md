# Script: For Loops

## Are for loops bad

- Make it very clear that for loops are not universally bad!

## At the end

- Mention that there is an other common loop pattern (the filtering loop) that we will
  cover in the next screencast about if conditions
- Mention again, that there will be more elegant constructs later but that everyone
  needs to understand loops and should use them without hesitation for now
