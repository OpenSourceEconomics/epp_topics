# Preparation

We assume you have:

- Installed VS Code with all relevant Python extensions
- Opened the root directory of your project in VS Code

# Example project structure


```mermaid {theme: 'dark', scale: 0.8}
graph LR
    classDef highlight fill:#FF4500;
    A["epp_project"] --- B["exercises"]
    B["exercises"] --- C["exercise_1.ipynb"]
    B["exercises"] --- D["exercise_2.py"]
    A["epp_project"] --- E["datasets"]
    E["datasets"] --- F["data.csv"]
```

<br/>

- The entire directory `epp_project` is opened in VS Code
- We want to run `exercise_2.ipynb` in VS Code
