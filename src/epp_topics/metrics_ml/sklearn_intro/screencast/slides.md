# Loading datasets from scikit-learn

- Toy datasets can be found using `sklearn.datasets.load_*`

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
  diabets = load_diabetes()
  ```

- Real world datasets can be downloaded using `sklearn.datasets.fetch_*`

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
  housing = fetch_california_housing()
  ```

- Some datasets can be generated using `sklearn.datasets.make_*`

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
  X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=0.1)
  ```

---

# Example: California Housing

<div style="margin-top:-1.5em;">

```python
>>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
>>> housing = fetch_california_housing()
>>> housing.keys()
dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'frame', 'target_names', 'feature_names', 'DESCR'])
```

```python
>>> housing["data"].shape
(20640, 8)
```

```python
>>> housing["feature_names"]
['MedInc', 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms', 'AveBedrms', 'Population', 'AveOccup', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']
```

```python
>>> housing["target"].shape
(20640,)
```

```python
>>> housing["target_names"]
['MedHouseVal']
```
</div>
Re-define the target as 1 if the value is above the 70th-percentile, 0 otherwise:
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> target = (housing["target"] > np.quantile(housing["target"], q=0.7)).astype(int)
```

# Train-test splits

<div class="grid grid-cols-[52%_48%] gap-4">
<div>


```python
>>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
>>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
...   housing["data"],
...   target,
...   random_state=1234,
...   test_size=0.3,
... )
>>> X_train.shape
(14448, 8)
```
```python
>>> y_train.shape
(14448,)
```
```python
>>> X_test.shape
(6192, 8)
```
```python
>>> y_test.shape
(6192,)
```
</div>
<div>

- The function `train_test_split` lets you:

  - select the test set size

  - set `random_state` for reproducibility

</div>
</div>

# Basic scikit-learn steps

- Choose a class of models by importing the appropriate estimator

- Set hyperparameters by instantiating this class

- Arrange data into a features matrix and target vector

- Fit the model to your data by calling the `fit()` method on the model instance

- Apply the model to new data using the `predict()` method

- Evaluate the quality of predictions


---

# Running Logistic regression in Sklearn


<div class="grid grid-cols-[52%_48%] gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
>>> model = LogisticRegression(
...   fit_intercept=True,
...   penalty=None,
... )
>>> model.fit(X_train, y_train)
>>> y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

```python
>>> y_pred
array([0, 0, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0])
```

```python
>>> model.score(X_test, y_test)
0.8320413436692506
```

</div>
<div>

- Use the `LogisticRegression` classifier from `sklearn` to create the model object

- Fit the model to the _training_ set to estimate the parameters

- Use the `predict()` method to generate predictions

- Use the `score()` method on the _test_ set to assess model quality

</div>
</div>

# Accuracy Score

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\mathbf{1}\{y_i=\hat{y}_i\}$$

```python
>>> from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
>>> accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
0.8320413436692506
```

- Measures the share of correctly predicted data points

- Advantage: Just one number

- Disadvantage: Might not be what you care about


---
layout: center

# Accuracy with imbalanced data


- **Imbalanced data**: Some outcomes occur more frequent than others in the data

- Example: Predicting whether someone has a PhD in a classroom with 49 students and one professor

- Models can "cheat" by predicting majority outcome

- Accurracy would be 98 % but model did not learn anything

- Will need other scores to discover such problems

# The Confusion Matrix
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> confusion = confusion_matrix(
...     y_test, y_pred, normalize="true"
... )
```
```python
>>> labels = ["Below 70th", "Above 70th"]
>>> confusion = pd.DataFrame(
...   confusion,
...   columns=labels,
...   index=labels,
... )
>>> confusion
              Below 70th    Above 70th
Below 70th      0.931839      0.068161
Above 70th      0.399678      0.600322

```
</div>
<div>

- Rows  are the true labels

- Columns are the predictions

- The rows always sum to 1

- Diagonal elements show the share of correctly classified examples in each category

- Element `["Above 70th", "Below 70th"]`: 39.9678 \% of observations with true
  label `"Above 70th"` got missclassified as `"Below 70th"`
</div>
</div>

# A note on the different scores

- Think of scores as different summaries of the confusion matrix

- Scores are first calculated for each category

- An aggregation strategy converts them into one score for the entire model

- Only some aggregation strategies work for imbalanced data

# Precision Score
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
>>> precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average=None)
array([0.84407702, 0.79137199])
```

$$\text{Precision}_k = \frac{TP_k}{TP_k+FP_k}$$

</div>
<div>

- For each class, measures the probability of the predicted positive case
  actually being truly positive ($TP_k$)

- $FP_k$ (*false positive*) is the total number of examples classified as label $k$, but actually from a different class

- Preferred metric when false positive predictions are costly

</div>
</div>

# Recall Score
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
>>> from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
>>> recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average=None)
array([0.93183919, 0.60032189])
```

$$\text{Recall}_k = \frac{TP_k}{TP_k+FN_k}$$

</div>
<div>

- For each class, measures the model's ability to find the positive cases

- $FN_k$ (*false negative*) is the total number of examples actually from class $k$ that were not predicted by the model as such

</div>
</div>

# $F_1$ Score
<div class="grid grid-cols-[430px_490px] gap-3">
<div>

```python
>>> from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
>>> f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average=None)
array([0.88578959, 0.68273337])
```

$$F_{1,k} = 2\frac{\text{Precision}_k \cdot \text{Recall}_k}{\text{Precision}_k + \text{Recall}_k}$$

</div>
<div>

- $F_1$ score is the *harmonic mean* of precision and recall

- For a given class, there is a trade-off in precision and recall

- $F_1$ balances the two motives

- Good choice if you have no reason to penalize one error more than the another

</div>
</div>

# Summary

- Accuracy: share of correct predictions

- Precision: True positives over positive predictions

- Recall: True positives over actual positives

- $F_1$: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall

# Scores with imbalanced data

- Same example with 49 students and one professor

- Models can "cheat" by predicting majority outcome
  - Accurracy: 98 \%
  - Precision: 98 \% for majority, 0 for minority class
  - Recall: 100 \% for majority, 0 for minority class
  - $F_1$: 99 \% for majority, 0 for minority class

- If we just look at scores for majority, we don't see problems

- Unfortunately that is what you get by default in `sklearn` in the binary case

# Aggregation Strategies
<div class="grid grid-cols-[40%_60%] gap-4">
<div>


```python
>>> precision_score(
...   y_test,
...   y_pred,
...   average="macro"
... )
0.8177245070078974
```
```python
>>> precision_score(
...   y_test,
...   y_pred,
...   average="weighted"
... )
0.8282110365957613
```
</div>
<div>

- `"macro"` strategy takes the simple mean over scores for each class:

  $\text{Precision}^{(\text{macro})} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K \text{Precision}_k$

- `"weighted"` strategy weights the scores by the relative sizes of the classes

  $\text{Precision}^{(\text{weighted})} = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k \cdot \text{Precision}_k$

- Aggregate $F_1$ score is the harmonic mean of the aggregate precision and recall

# Sklearn's Classification Report

>>> from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
>>> report = classification_report(

... print(report)
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

  Below 70th       0.84      0.93      0.89      4328
  Above 70th       0.79      0.60      0.68      1864

    accuracy                           0.83      6192
   macro avg       0.82      0.77      0.78      6192
weighted avg       0.83      0.83      0.82      6192
```
