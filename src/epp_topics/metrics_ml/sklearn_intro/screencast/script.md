  - select the test set size

  - set random_state for reproducibility

# Basic scikit-learn steps

- Choose a class of models by importing the appropriate estimator

- Set hyperparameters by instantiating this class

- Arrange data into a features matrix and target vector

- Fit the model to your data by calling the `fit()` method on the model instance

- Apply the model to new data using the `predict()` method

- Evaluate the quality of predictions
