# The Fundamental difference

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

**Econometrics**

- Estimate **fundamentally unobservable** parameters and test hypotheses about them

- Cannot test how well it worked

- Focus on justifying assumptions

</div>
<div>

**(Supervised) Machine learning**

- Predict observable things

- Can check how well it works

- Focus on experimentation, evaluation and finding out what works

</div>

# Some implications

- Even though it is tempting, you cannot interpret parameters

- Can be creative in combining simple models into complex ones

- Rapid progress and development of new models

- Programming skills matter more

# Supervised vs unsupervised learning

- **Supervised learning**

  - Training data contains labeled examples of the task to solve

  - Model generalizes this to unseen data

  - Example: Regression, classification

- **Unsupervised learning**

  - Training with label free data

  - Model finds patterns in data

  - Example: Clustering, dimensionality reduction

---

# Overfitting

- Estimating large models on small datasets can lead to overfitting

- Overfitting means:

  - Model can explain the concrete dataset well

  - Model would not work on any other dataset

  - Same reason why we need adjusted $R^2$ in econometrics

  - Need to make sure our model evaluation accounts for overfitting!

- Example: Estimate person fixed effects in short panel

---

# The bias-variance trade-off

- Econometrics: Model is correctly specified, want consistency and unbiasedness

- Very simple models, e.g. just an intercept and a couple of regressors

  - Large bias, low variance, no overfitting

- Very large models, e.g. including squares, interactions, ...

  - Small bias, high variance, danger of overfitting

- ML: Model is a simplification and some amount of bias is ok

- Most ML models have one or more parameters that govern the bias variance trade-off


---

# Holdout samples

- Split data into training and test dataset

- Fitting and experimentation is only done on training data

- Evaluation is only done on test data

  - Overfitting on training data cannot influence the evaluation

  - Need to avoid leaking any information from test data into model training!

- Typical sizes:

  - 70 to 80 percent for training

  - Rest for validation

---

# Hyperparameters

- No parameters of the model itself

- Instead: Control behavior of the model algorithm

- E.g., balance bias and variance
