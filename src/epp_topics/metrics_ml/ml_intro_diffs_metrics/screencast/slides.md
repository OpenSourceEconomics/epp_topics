### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

<br/>

# Data Analysis in Python

### Introduction to Machine Learning

# The Fundamental difference

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

## Econometrics

- Estimate **fundamentally unobservable** parameters and test hypotheses about them
- Cannot test how well it worked
- Focus on justifying assumptions

</div>
<div>

## (Supervised) Machine learning

- Predict observable things
- Can check how well it works
- Focus on experimentation, evaluation and finding out what works

</div>
</div>

# Some implications

- Even though it is tempting, you cannot interpret parameters
- Can be creative in combining simple models into complex ones
- Rapid progress and development of new models
- Programming skills matter more

# Supervised vs un-supervised learning

- **supervised learning**
  - Training data contains labeled examples of the task to solve
  - Model generalizes this to unseen data
  - Example: Regression, classification
- **unsupervised learning**
  - Training with label free data
  - Model finds patterns in data
  - Example: Clustering, dimensionality reduction
- **self-supervised learning**: Middle ground we discuss later

# Terminology

- **feature, attribute**: x-variable, independent variable
- **target**: y-variable, dependent variable
- **model**: estimator
- **fitting**: running an estimation
- **classification**: regression with discrete dependent variable
- **logistic regression**: binary or multivariate logit
- **instance**: observation
- **classes**: possible values of a discrete dependent variables
