### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

# Debugging

### Psychology of debugging

<br/>


JanoÅ› Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# The urge to skip reading


> Tracebacks are long and not always helpful, so most people have the urge to skip
> them. Similarly, it takes a lot of effort to thoroughly read code line by line

<br/>

- Read tracebacks until you
  - Know in which line the error ocurred
  - Have found the type of error that ocurred
  - Have read the message at the end of the traceback
- When you located a bug to less than 30 lines of code
  - Read every line and explain to someone what it does
  - Someone can be a rubber duck

# The urge to just run it again

> When code does not run, there is a tendency to just execute it again

<br/>

- Computers are deterministic
- If you run the same code twice, it produces the same result
- If it does not runs the first time but it runs the second time, you have a way bigger problem than before!

# The urge to tell yourself it should work

> There is tendency during debugging to explain to yourself that and why the code should
> work.

<br/>

- Computers do exactly what you tell them to do in a deterministic fashion
- If you are debugging, something did not work
- Don't explain why it should work, when it clearly does not

# The urge to try out things

> Errors are stressful, we want them to go away. So there is a tendency to make a
> any changes that could fix errors.

<br/>

- Take a deep breath and relax
- Make sure to commit before you try out things
- Change one thing at a time, for a reason!

# The urge to blame libraries

> We thought our code was correct, so there is a tendency to blame problems on
> python itself, libraries or library versions

<br/>

- Most libraries we use are well tested and written by better programmers than you are
- Some are used so much that any bug would have found by someone else first
- Until you have a lot of evidence to the contrary, assume libraries are correct
- If you find a bug in a library, report it to the authors!
