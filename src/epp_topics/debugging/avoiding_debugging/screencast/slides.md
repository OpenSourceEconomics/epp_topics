# Debugging

### Avoiding debugging

# How editors avoid debugging

- Code highlighting shows differences between
  - variables / functions
  - built-in statements
  - string literals
  - comments
- Syntax checkers flag
  - spelling errors
  - undefined variables
  - syntax errors


---

# How unit tests avoid debugging

- If your function is thoroughly tested:
  - It will produce correct outputs given valid inputs
  - You can skip it while debugging (at least initially)
- Careful
  - Having one test per function is usually not enough
  - Need at least make sure to cover all lines
  - Also think about difficult edge cases and test them


---

# How error handling avoids debugging

- If your function does thorough error handling
  - It will complain when called with invalid inputs
  - You can locate easily where things go wrong
- Careful
  - You do not want to add error handling to private helper functions
  - To be useful, the error messages need to be good

# How readability avoids debugging

- If you write readable modular code
  - All functions have a clear purpose, so it is easy to see whether they do what they
    should
  - Variable names are informative about content
  - You can easily simulate in your head what the code does
- Problem:
  - This is hard and takes practice!
