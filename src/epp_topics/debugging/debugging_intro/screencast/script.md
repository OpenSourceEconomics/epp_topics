# Script: Introduction to debugging

## why debugging is important

- About different debugging efficiencies: Most of them have made the experience that we
  look at their bugs and immediately find the problems or ask them to check one or two
  things before finding it. Explain that this is not because we know the solution to the
  assignments but because we use the strategies they will learn next.

- About avoiding debugging: Say that the main tools are testing and error handling (in
  that order)

- About becoming better at debugging: Say that this is the topic of the chapter and it
  involves a mix of strategies and tools; All of them together make you better at
  debugging.

## The two modes

- "No experimentation but thinking about the code": Maybe mention a few examples:

  - The hardest SID bug was solved lying on a sofa with eyes closed and just thinking
  - A hard LCM bug was solved on the whiteboard
  - I have solved many bugs on bike tours

- "Striking parallel to the scientific method":

  - inspeculation -> theory building
  - data gathering -> experimentation
