# Setting a breakpoint


<div class="flex gap-4">
<div>

#### Simple

```python{2}
def cobb_douglas(x1, x2, gamma1, gamma2, a):
    import pdbp; breakpoint()
    return (a * x1**gamma1 * x2**gamma2,)
```

#### Conditional

```python{2-3}
def cobb_douglas(x1, x2, gamma1, gamma2, a):
    if gamma1 <= 0.5:
        import pdbp; breakpoint()
    return (a * x1**gamma1 * x2**gamma2,)
```

</div>
<div>

<br/>

- Set a breakpoint with `import pdbp; breakpoint()`
- You can do that anywhere!
  - Inside function definitions
  - In loops
  - In if conditions!
- Execution will stop at the breakpoint and show you the interactive debug prompt

</div>
</div>

# Important commands


| Command  | Action                                          |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `n`      | Execute the **n**ext line                       |
| `s`      | Execute the next **s**tep                       |
| `c`      | **c**ontinue until the next breakpoint          |
| `u`      | Go one frame **u**p (go backwards through code) |
| `d`      | Go **d**own one frame (go forward through code) |
| `exit`   | Stop the debugging (also `ctrl + d`)            |

- Do not use any of those as variable names!

# Graphical alternatives

- VScode and other IDEs have graphical debuggers
    - Set breakpoints via clicking
    - Variable explorers
- We prefer the terminal for several reasons
    - Integrates perfectly with pytask and pytest
    - Extremely fast once you get a bit of practice
    - More robust (in our experience)
