    "# Functional data cleaning: The Why\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Our fundamental rules for data cleaning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with an empty DataFrame\n",
    "1. Touch every variable just once\n",
    "1. Touch with a pure function\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this topic, you should be able to explain how these rules help\n",
    "achieve the following five goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the importance of never modifying source data\n",
    "- Discuss the importance of separating data management and analysis\n",
    "- Explain how functions can help to make data management code readable and testable\n",
    "- Discuss strategies to minimize side effects in data management code\n",
    "- Discuss strategies to make data management in notebooks more robust\n",
