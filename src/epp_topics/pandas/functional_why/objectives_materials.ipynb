    "# Functional data cleaning: The Why\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Our fundamental rules for data cleaning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with an empty DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Touch every variable just once\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Touch with a pure function\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this topic, you should be able to explain how these rules help\n",
    "achieve the following five goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code must be readable at different levels of abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pipeline always starts from the original data, which is never modified\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Must be able to find out quickly what a variable contains\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There must not be state in any column's contents\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data management and analysis should be separated\n",
