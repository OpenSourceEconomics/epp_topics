# What is **modern** pandas?

- Pandas was created in 2008 and has some baggage
- With version 3.0 many things will improve
- Those features can already be enabled now:
  - More speed and less memory usage through better dtypes
  - Less confusion through copy-on-write
  - Better handling of missing values
  - Removal of the `inplace` argument

# How to use modern pandas

- Install version 2.1 or higher of pandas
- Install version 13.0 or higher of pyarrow
- Set some options after import

```python
import pandas as pd

pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True
pd.options.future.infer_string = True
```

- When loading datasets, use `engine="pyarrow"` if available
