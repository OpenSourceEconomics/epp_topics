# Script: DataFrames and Series

## What is a DataFrame

About the mental models

- Matrix with labels is a good mental model for thinking about datasets
- Dict of columns is a good mental model to understand performance characteristics

## Creating DataFrames and Series

Whenever someone asks Jano≈õ about their pandas problems he will

- create tiny inputs to recreate the situation
- solve the problem on those tiny inputs.
- Seems like extra work, but once you are good at it costs almost no time
- Can make the debugging 10 or 100 x faster!

Of course, this needs quite a bit of rethinking when you come from Stata
