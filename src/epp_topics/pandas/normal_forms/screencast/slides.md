# Data management with pandas

### Rules for data management

<br>


Jano≈õ Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# Motivation

- So far we have shown you the mechanics of using pandas
- Now we talk about general best practices
  - Can save weeks of work in large projects
  - Grounded in database research


---

# 1. Never ever change source data

- **Source data**: Original dataset as downloaded or collected
- Commit the source data to git and never change it
- All modified datasets should be stored under different names
- Modified datasets should not be under version control!


---

# 2. Separate data management and analysis

- **Data management**: Converting source data to formats your analysis programs need
- Separate data management code from analysis code
- Never modify the content of a variable outside the data management code!


---

# 3. Values have no internal structure

- a.k.a. the **first normal form**
- I.e., no need for parsing values before using them
- E.g. store first names and last names separately
- Not too often a problem in economic data
  - X-digit industrial or educational classifiers
  - Store each digit level you need in a separate variable

---

# 4. Tables do not contain redundant information

- a.k.a. the **second normal form**
- In a panel structure: Store time-constant characteristics in a
  separate table
- Violations make things much harder and error-prone:
  - Changes to data
  - Consistency checks
  - Selecting observations


---

# 5. No structure in variable names

- a.k.a. use long format if you can
- There should not be different variables with similar content
  referring to different time periods etc.
- If you need wide format for regressions, still do your data management in long format
