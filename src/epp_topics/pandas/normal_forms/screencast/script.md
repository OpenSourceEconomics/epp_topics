## Motivation

Maybe add one example of a large data management project where this was relevant

## Rule 1

Explain in detail that modified datasets don't need to be under version control as long

______________________________________________________________________

## 2. Separate data management and analysis

______________________________________________________________________

## 3. Values have no internal structure

______________________________________________________________________

## 4. Tables do not contain redundant information

Explain that this is a rule for doing data management. It might have to be violated for
running regressions. But then the merge should happen in the last possible moment at the
end of data management.

# 5. No structure in variable names

Explain that this is a rule for doing data management. It might have to be violated for
running regressions. But then the reshaping should happen in the last possible moment at
the end of data management.

There will be a screencast on converting between long and wide in the future.
