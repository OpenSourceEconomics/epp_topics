# Script: Data management: Tips, tricks, and advanced topics

## Motivation

- Explain that real-world data often has complex structures
- These principles help organize data efficiently and avoid errors

## Values have no internal structure (First normal form)

- Walk through the concept of atomic values
- Give examples like storing first and last names separately
- Mention industrial/educational classifiers

## No redundant information (Second normal form)

- Explain why redundant information is problematic
- Give the panel data example (time-constant vs time-varying characteristics)
- Discuss the problems that arise from violations

## No structure in variable names (Long vs wide format)

- Show the table comparison on the slide
- Explain why long format is preferred for data management
- Mention that wide format may be needed for specific analyses, but do data management
  in long format first
