# Script: Data cleaning example

## Introduction

- This screencast introduces a practical example for data cleaning
- Will be used in subsequent screencasts

## Example dataset

- Made up, but the steps needed for obtaining clean variables are quite realistic
- Explain the metadata: Q001, Q002, Q003 and the missing value codes
- Important property: Simple structure — one row is one observation
  - Always want this; also in more complex situations (e.g., interview the same people
    at the end of the course again)
  - See video on complex data structures for how to achieve that; will abstract from
    this in "data cleaning"; focus purely on variables with this structure
