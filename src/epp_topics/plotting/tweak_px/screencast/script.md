# Script: Customise plots created with plotly express

## Facet cols

- Back to Chromium, look for facet cols
- Copy from there, replace by continent

## Overall appearance

- Presentation mode: Larger font, thicker lines, no axes
- Removing legend would make sense here
- Go to Chromium, look for "Customizing Subplot Figure Titles"
