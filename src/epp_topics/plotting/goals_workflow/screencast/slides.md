# Typical Goals of Plotting

1. Summarize data to quickly learn about patterns in data
   - Trends over time
   - Bivariate patterns (scatterplot, regression line)
1. Highlight insights and tell stories
   - Leave out unnecessary information
   - Use accent colors for most interesting points


---

# 1. Exploration

- Goal: Find patterns in data
- Making a plot has to be fast!
- Interactivity is important
- Using clear labels always helps

---

# 2. Publication

- Goal: Communicate patterns in data/results
- Plot needs to be self-explanatory
- Aesthetics is key
- Papers need static plots

---

# Workflow

1. Think: What question should the plot answer? What type of information should it
   convey?
1. Sketch the plot on paper
1. Find a similar plot in the documentation of your plotting library
1. Make a quick plot to see if your ideas work
1. Make it pretty
1. Make sure the plot is self-explanatory (ask someone else)
