# Script: Goals and Workflow

## Typical Goals of Plotting

- Of course not limited to this and many intermediate cases. But useful distinction
  covering most use cases.
- Conclude: Telling stories and highlighting insights is important but of course the
  plot has to stay honest

## 1. Exploration

- Main addressee: yourself
- Are data what I expect? Outliers, Patterns, ...
- Clear labels imperative when working with coauthors - intermediate case to second
  purpose

## 2. Publication

- Self-explanatory: Cannot stress enough

## Workflow

### 1. — 3.: goals setting

- As always in programming (or most areas of life): Make sure that you have a clear goal
  and general feasibility in mind before worrying about precise details
- In particular, use sketching to work out some details before worrying about syntax

### 4. — 6.: Implementation

- Ofc, in case of exploratory plots, ending at 4. might be enough
