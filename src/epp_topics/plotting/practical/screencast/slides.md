# Why we use plotly in class

- Interactive plots work out of the box
- Supports all relevant output formats:
    - Interactive dashboards
    - HTML
    - static image formats
- Also available in R and Julia

# Windows Issues

- On some windows computers, the static export gets stuck
- A workaround is to install and old version of kaleido

```txt
pip install kaleido==0.1.0.post1
```
- You need to do this after activating your environment!
