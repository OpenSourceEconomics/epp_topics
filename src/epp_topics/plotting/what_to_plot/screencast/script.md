# Script: Plotting practical

## Plot entire data

- Start with slides
- Then Chromium, https://plotly.com/python open
- check gallery and click on line charts, go to second cell
- Then notebook, click through first cells
- Note that line takes same keyword arguments as backend

## Facet cols

- Copy pandas backend stuff, convert to `px.line`
- Back to Chromium, look for facet cols
- Copy from there, replace by continent

## Overall appearance

- Presentation mode: Larger font, thicker lines, no axes
- Removing legend would make sense here
- Go to Chromium, look for "Customizing Subplot Figure Titles"

## Graph objects

- Goal: Highlight Poland and Canada
- Just go through stuff slowly
