# Script: A primer on Graphs

# Graph definition

- Very abstract, dry
- Good thing: Very easy to work with for a computer
- Luckily for human beings, there is a very intuitive visualisation

# Chains

- Always: Definition on the left, visualisation on the right
- Chain: One node after the other
- Undirected: Edges are sets of two nodes, so could reverse
- Can't do that with directed graphs: Edges are pairs of nodes

# Trees

- Only one way to get from one node to another
- No cycles, could not have connection from x_4 to x_6, for example
- Directed: Each node has exactly one parent, except for the root (ofc)
- Now add an arrow from x_4 to x_6

# DAGs

- Super-important concept
- No directed cycles: Cannot get from one node to another by following arrows

# Graph Use Cases

Cannot stress importance enough
