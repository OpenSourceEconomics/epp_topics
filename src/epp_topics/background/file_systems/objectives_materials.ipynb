    "\n",
    "After working through this topic, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- describe how a file system is organised.\n",
    "- explain the most important differences between Unix-based and Windows-based file\n",

    "## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working through this material, it should be helpful to go through the background\n",
    "material on the history of operating systems and on graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the\n",
    "[Screencast](https://player.uni-bonn.educast.nrw/7a1c2ae3-2614-4fc5-939e-6bde0663a83e).\n",
    "These are the [slides](background-file_systems.pdf). Some verbal explanations are\n",
    "reproduced below.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important difference that is not mentioned in the screencast is that Unix-based file\n",
    "systems are case-sensitive, whereas Windows-based file systems are not. This means that\n",
    "`Documents` and `documents` are two different directories on Unix-based systems, but the\n",
    "same directory on Windows. This can lead to subtle differences when running the same\n",

    "### Unix File System\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/` is the root directory.\n",
    "- `etc` is a directory under root that contains configuration files.\n",
    "- `usr` is another directory under root, which contains several other directories,\n",
    "  including `bin` (for executable files) and `lib` (for library files).\n",
    "- `var` is a directory under root that contains variable data like system logging files,\n",
    "  and log is a directory under var for log files.\n",
    "- `home` is a directory under root that contains personal directories for users, such as\n",
    "  `user_1`. On MacOS, `home` is called `Users` (with capital U).\n",
    "- `user_1` has personal documents and download directories.\n",
    "- `mambaforge` is a directory under `user_1` that contains the mamba package manager for\n",
    "  creating Python environments (unless you choose to install the entire Anaconda Python\n",
    "  distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows File System\n",
    "\n",
    "- `C:` is the root directory.\n",
    "- `Program Files` is where applications are typically installed.\n",
    "- `Users` is where user directories are located.\n",
    "- `user_1` represents the `user_1`'s home directory with Documents and Download as\n",
    "  typical examples of subdirectories\n",
    "- `Windows` is where the operating system files are located.\n",
    "- `System32` is a directory within `Windows` that contains important system files.\n",
    "- `ProgramData` is used to store application and operating system data.\n",
    "- `mambaforge` is where the mamba package manager is located if you choose to install\n",
    "  that.\n",
    "- Each disk (physical or virtual) gets its own directory tree.\n",
    "- They are not connected, but you can jump between them using the drive letters.\n",
