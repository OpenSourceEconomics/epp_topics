# Script: A Brief History of Operating Systems

## Two broad lines of Operating Systems

- Roots of Unix go back to a time where there were no personal computers
- What you see here is Video Terminal 100 (VT100) from 1978
- It was connected to a mainframe computer, which was the size of a room
- These mainframes were typically running Unix

## Unix

- Unix was developed at Bell labs starting 1969
- Economically interesting history:
  - Bell labs was a a subsidiary of AT&T, which back then held telecommunications
    monopoly
  - Regulation was such that company could not charge for anything outside of that
    market
  - So licensed to many companies for free in 1970s
  - Changed after monopoly was broken up
-

## Unix-inspired

- GNU tools still in wide use
- Importantly, these were , only utilities, not the kernel itself

## MacOS X

- Apple Macintoshs had their own operating system, which went up to version 9
- Personal history:
  - I was born and raised in Hannover
  - Far too little hotel room capacity for the big trade fairs
  - Private lodging was a thing
  - Apparently, in the early '90s my parents rented out the rooms of my sister and me to
    people from NeXT
  - At least we had a stack of T-Shirts with that logo on them floating around for
    years...
- Anyhow, NeXT as a company did not last long, but NeXTstep is still alive and kicking
  under the name Mac OS X

## Windows

- With a couple of exceptions, completely separate from Unix world.
- Originally MS DOS
