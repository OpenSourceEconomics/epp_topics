### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

# Numerical Optimization

### Derivative Free Direct Search Algorithm(s)

# Basic Idea

- Explore parameter space around current point systematically and accept the best value
- Also called pattern search because the points at which the function is evaluated form a pattern
- Easiest example for one dimensional problems:
    - Evaluate function at current point and one other point
    - Switch direction of other point if you got an increase in function value
    - Make steps larger after success
    - Make steps smaller after failure

The following is just an illustration of the principle. The trust region radius is updated manually to simulate a real algorithm.

Note that a real algorithm is quite complex to implement. You should never do that yourself. Leave it to experts unless
- you are a very good programmer;
- you have read a few books on optimization algorithms;
- you have a very special problem that cannot be solved with existing algorithms.

# Some Remarks

- Adjusting the step size and switching to promising directions is complicated in real algorithms
- Direct search algorithms only use the information which function value is smallest, not by how much
- Makes them slow but robust to small amounts of noise
- It does not help for large amounts of noise
- Most famous example is the Nelder-Mead algorithm which is widely used, but seldomly the best choice
