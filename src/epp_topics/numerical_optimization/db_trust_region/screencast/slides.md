### Derivative-Based (DB) Trust Region Algorithm(s)

# Basic Idea

1. Fix a trust region radius.

2. Construct a Taylor approximation of the function based on function value, gradient,
   and (approximation to) the Hessian.

    The Taylor approximation:
    - approximates the function well within the trust region if radius is not too large;
    - is a quadratic function that it easy to optimize.

3. Minimize the Taylor approximation within the trust region.

4. Evaluate the function again at the argmin of the Taylor approximation.

5. Compare expected and actual improvement.

6. Accept the new parameters if actual improvement is good enough.

7. Potentially modify the trust region radius (**important and complex step**).

8. Go back to 2.

# Smaller radii lead to better approximations

- Take any function $f$ that is at least three times continuously differentiable.

- For a step $s$, the Taylor expansion of $f(x + s)$ around $x$ satisfies:

  $f(x + s) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^\top s + \frac{1}{2} s^\top \nabla^2 f(x) s + o(\|s\|^2)$.

- The step $s$ is bounded by the trust region radius $\Delta$: $\|s\| \leq \Delta$.

- And therefore, as $\Delta$ decreases the approximation error $o(\|s\|^2)$ decreases.

# DB Trust Region: an Illustration

The following is just an illustration of the principle. The trust region radius is updated manually to simulate a real algorithm.

Note that a real algorithm is quite complex to implement. You should never do that yourself. Leave it to experts unless:
- you are a very good programmer;
- you have read a few books on optimization algorithms;
- you have a very special problem that cannot be solved with existing algorithms.

# Some Remarks

- Most of the time, the approximation was not very good but sent us in the right direction.
- After a successful iteration, the trust region radius is increased.
- At some point it becomes too large and needs to be decreased.
- From now on the algorithm would converge soon because of a zero gradient.
- Even when it converges, the trust region radius does not shrink to zero.
