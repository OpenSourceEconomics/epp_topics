# Numerical Optimization

### Derivative-Free Trust Region Algorithm(s)

# Basic Idea

- Similar to derivative based trust region algorithm.
- Instead of Taylor expansion, use a surrogate model based on interpolation or regression.
    - Interpolation: Function is evaluated at exactly as many points as you need to fit the model.
    - Regression: Function is evaluated at more points than you strictly need. Better for noisy functions.
    - In general: Evaluation points are spread further out than for numerical derivatives.
- How the evaluation points are determined is complicated. It is also crucial for the efficiency of the algorithm.

The following is just an illustration of the principle. The trust region radius is updated manually to simulate a real algorithm.

Note that a real algorithm is quite complex to implement. You should never do that yourself. Leave it to experts unless:
- you are a very good programmer;
- you have read a few books on optimization algorithms;
- you have a very special problem that cannot be solved with existing algorithms.

# Some Remarks

- The fit is generally better than the gradient based trust region algorithm
- By construction especially at corners of trust region
- Choose between the two based on computation speed
    - If you have fast closed form derivatives, use the derivative based algorithm
    - If you only have numerical derivatives, use this instead
- Points at which the function has been evaluated before can be re-used to save function evaluations
- Since no gradient is available, algorithm will continue until trust region radius shrinks to zero
- It's intuitively very clear how this can work for noisy functions if enough evaluations are used for each surrogate model
