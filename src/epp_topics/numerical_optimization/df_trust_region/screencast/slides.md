### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

# Numerical Optimization

### Derivative-Free Trust Region Algorithms

# Basic Idea

- Similar to derivative based trust region algorithm.

- Instead of Taylor approximation, use a surrogate model based on interpolation or regression.

    - Interpolation: Function is evaluated at exactly as many points as you need to fit the model.

    - Regression: Function is evaluated at more points than you strictly need. Better for noisy functions.

    - In general: Evaluation points are spread further out than for numerical derivatives.

- How the evaluation points are determined is complicated. It is also crucial for the efficiency of the algorithm.

# Some Remarks

- Within the trust region, the fit is generally better than the gradient based trust region algorithm

- By construction especially at corners of trust region

- Choose between the two based on computation speed

    - If you have fast closed form derivatives, use the derivative based algorithm

    - If you only have numerical derivatives, use this instead

- Points at which the function has been evaluated before can be re-used to save function evaluations

- Since no gradient is available, algorithm will continue until trust region radius shrinks to zero

- It's intuitively very clear how this can work for noisy functions if enough evaluations are used for each surrogate model
