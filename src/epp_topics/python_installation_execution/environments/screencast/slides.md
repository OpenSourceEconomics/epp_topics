### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

# Installation and execution

### Environment files

# Environment files vs. environments

- **environment.yml**:
    - A recipe to create environments
    - Under version control
    - Shared with team members
- **environment**:
    - A collection of python packages stored on your computer
    - Independent of other environments you might have
- You get from environment files to environments by using

`mamba env create -f environment.yml`

# Anatomy of `environment.yml`

<div class="flex gap-4">
<div>

```yaml
name: mini-env
channels: [conda-forge, nodefaults]
dependencies:
  - python==3.11
  - pandas
  - pip:
      - pdbp
```

</div>
<div>

- Name can be anything (not containing spaces)
- Channels: You rarely need more than conda-forge
- Dependencies: List of Python packages and python
  - Can have equality or inequality constraints on versions
  - Only use pip for packages that are not conda/mamba installable
- Environment files should be hand-written and maintained

</div>
</div>

# Dependencies are installed automatically

- The mini environment from above will contain the following packages
- Many are low-level dependencies you don't have to care about
- Some exact versions are OS specific
- Listing all of them would create a non-portable environment

# How to add a package

- Just installing packages into an environment from the shell is not reproducible
- Instead:
  - Add the package to `environment.yml`
  - Use `mamba env update -f environment.yml`
- If you have any problem:
  - `mamba env remove --name mini-env`
  - `mamba env create -f environment.yml`
