### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

# Installation and execution

### Environment files and environments

# Environment files vs. environments

- An **environment.yml** file:
  - A recipe to create an environment
  - Under version control
  - Shared with team members
- A conda/mamba **environment**:
  - A collection of Python packages stored on your computer
  - Independent of other environments you might have
- You create an environment from an environment file by typing

  ```
  mamba env create -f environment.yml
  ```

# Anatomy of environment.yml

<div class="flex gap-4">
<div>

```yaml
name: mini-env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - nodefaults
dependencies:
  - python==3.11
  - pandas
  - pip:
      - pdbp
```

</div>
<div>

- Name can be anything, except that it must not contain spaces

- Channels: You rarely need more than conda-forge

- Dependencies: Python, list of Python packages

  - Can have equality or inequality constraints on versions

  - Only use pip for packages that are not conda/mamba installable

- Environment files should be hand-written and maintained

</div>
</div>

# Dependencies installed automatically

- The mini environment from above will contain the following packages

- Most are low-level dependencies you don't have to care about

- Some exact versions are OS specific

- Listing all of them would create a non-portable environment

# How to add a package

- Just installing packages into an environment from the shell is not reproducible

- Instead:

  - Add the package to `environment.yml`

  - Use `mamba env update -f environment.yml`

- If you have any problem:

  - `mamba env remove -n mini-env`

  - `mamba env create -f environment.yml`
