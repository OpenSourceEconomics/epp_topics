### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

<br/>

# Texts, Typesetting, and Text Data

### Writing Readme Files

<br/>


Janoś Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# Readme.md

- Everybody sees this first when they visit your repository

  → Always format nicely using markdown

- In large projects, it could be a short visit

  → DRY. Just point to where the information below can be found

- In small projects, it might be the only place with text (≠ code)

  → Provide all relevant information

---

# Points to address

- Entry point to the project: What is the goal? How is that being achieved?

- How do I get it to run?

  - For experienced users: Make it easy to find the bare minimum (assumptions about
    sytem, precise commands)

  - For less experienced users: Provide links to background information

- Does it look like you cared?

  - about the project
  - about the reader (don't make it too long!)
