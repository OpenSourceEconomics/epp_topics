# Command line vs. GUIs

<br/>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12">

- More precise
- Do everything in one place and don't change windows
- Multiple steps can be chained and automated to become one

</div>
<div>

## GUI

<br/>

- Less need to memorize
- Use an interface that is designed specifically for your task
- No potential for automation or command chaining

- Huge payoffs in the long run!
- Many free apps to learn it!
- No single person has ever regretted to learn it
