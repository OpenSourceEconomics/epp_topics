# Script: Why use shells today?

## General

Maybe we sometimes made people feel guilty for not using terminals more. I think the
following should be made clear:

1. For some things they should use the shell: git, managing python envs
1. There is no reason to be afraid of typing commands and everyone will feel very slow
   when using the shell for the first time
1. Different people have different preferences (e.g. Tim vs. Janos) and nobody has to
   feel guilty for clicking sometimes

## Usecases slide

- Say that they won't be able to fully understand all usecases (e.g. tests and running
  automated pipelines). This is here to show them that there will be many benefits in
  the future so it is a good idea to already learn the shell

## Learn typing slide

- You can mention that Guido van Rossum cannot touch type, so everyone who is as smart
  as him is excused from learning it
