### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

<br/>

# Miscellaneous Tools

### Navigation in the Unix shell

<br/>


Jano≈õ Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

# Motivation

- Your shell has a present-working-directory (pwd)
- By default, the home directory
- Typically, you want the pwd to be your project folder
  - Can use right click in your file explorer (inefficient)
  - Can use `cd`
- Optionally, you can also create, copy and delete files in the shell

# Unix File System

```mermaid {theme: 'dark', scale: 1}

    A["/"] --- B["etc"]
    A["/"] --- C["usr"]
    C["usr"] --- D["bin"]

# Where to store your projects

- Good idea to store all git repositories somewhere close to home directory
- Example:

```mermaid {theme: 'dark', scale: 1}
graph LR
    A["/home/user_1"] --- B["projects"]
    B["projects"] --- C["master_thesis"]
    B["projects"] --- D["epp"]
    D["epp"] --- E["exercises"]
    D["epp"] --- F["assignments"]
    D["epp"] --- G["final_project"]
```

# The z command

- Only type rough names of files to jump to them
- Similar to fuzzy matching in VS Code!
- Gets better the more you use it!
