### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

# Miscellaneous Tools

### Navigation in the windows shell

# Motivation

- Your shell has a present-working-directory (pwd)
- By default, the home directory
- Typically, you want the pwd to be your project folder
  - Can use right click in your file explorer (inefficient)
  - Can use `cd`
- Optionally, you can also create, copy and delete files in the shell

# Where to store your programming projects

- Good idea to store all git repositories somewhere close to home directory
- Example:

```txt
C:\Users\user_name
  projects\
    master_thesis\
    epp\
      exercises\
      assignments\
      final_project\

```
