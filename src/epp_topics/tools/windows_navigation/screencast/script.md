# Script: Navigation in the windows shell

## Motivation

It should become clear that there is no way around learning to navigate in a shell. It
might seem optional now but once we learn more advanced tools it becomes essential

- Explain why we need to switch directories. Examples:
  - so we have to type less for copying or running files
  - to open notebooks in the right directory
  - to run all tests/tasks in a project

## Stay on the motivation slide and do a live demo

- Use pwd
- Show how to navigate into some folder
  - use pwd again to verify
  - use ls
- Show how to navigate out of the folder
  - use pwd to verify
- Show how to create a folder and navigate into it

## Where to store your programming projects

- Mention that it pays off to think about a directory structure that saves typing and is
  easy to memorize
- Maybe mention my setup: `/home/janos/Dropbox/Projects` for an extra layer of safety
  when I forget to commit or push
