# Script: Why and where to raise errors

## Motivation

- Possibly mention the extremely helpful error message we got when we needed
  `convert_categoricals=False`

## Example

- Mention that this will be the example for all screencasts on error handling
- I had to violate docstring conventions to get at least a minimal docstring for the
  public function on the slides
- They can take the data conversion function as given for now
