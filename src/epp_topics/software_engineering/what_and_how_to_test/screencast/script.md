# Script: What to test? How to test it?

## Introduction

Mention that we will see a couple of important ideas here

- Tests pin down the interface of a function / its desired behaviour
- Tests help you learn behaviour of programmes / libraries
- Always do counterchecks for your tests
- What shall we actually test?

## Always perform the countercheck

Mention that this will be done in screencast that reuses test functions
