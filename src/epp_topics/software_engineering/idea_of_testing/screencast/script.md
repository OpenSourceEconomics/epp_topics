# Script: Idea of testing

## Main message

- No matter how complicated your project is, it is made up of parts that can be tested

## Testing a simple function

- Say that it is surprising how many mistakes one can make when coding up simple
  functions!

## Testing interfaces not implementation

- Important: Testing does not only work for math functions
- Mention explicitly it also works for data management!
- In every complex project there are surprisingly many small helper functions that
  behave very deterministically and can be tested on tiny example inputs

## This works for any project

- I am paraphrasing a quote I have read before but could not find anymore. Take it out
  if you don't like that.

- If you cannot break your project into steps for which you know what they should do,
  you cannot write the code in the fist place!

- Analogy: This is how NASA gets rockets to fly. Each part is certified to comply to all
  specification and since all parts work, the entire thing usually works
