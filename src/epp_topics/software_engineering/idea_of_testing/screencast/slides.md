# The assert statement

<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

```python
>>> assert 5 == 6, "Numbers are not equal."
----------------------------------------------------
AssertionError     Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/janos/file.py line 1
----> 1 assert 5 == 6, "Numbers are not equal"

AssertionError: Numbers are not equal
```

<br/>

```python
>>> assert False, "This always fails."
----------------------------------------------------
AssertionError     Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/janos/file.py line 1
----> 1 assert False, "This always fails"

AssertionError: This always fails
```

</div>
<div>

- `assert` raises an error if a condition is not fulfilled
- Often used to check that assumptions about inputs are fulfilled
- Can also be used to test the behavior of functions

</div>

# Testing a simple function


<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

```python
def cobb_douglas(labor, capital, alpha):
    return labor ** alpha * capital ** (1 - alpha)

assert cobb_douglas(1, 1, 2) == 1
assert cobb_douglas(2, 1, 2) == 4
```

</div>
<div>

- Test cases can be calculated by hand for simple edge cases
- Sometimes you can get results from other libraries, textbooks, etc.
- If this runs without error, we are confident the function works for other inputs

</div>
</div>

# Testing interfaces, not implementation


<div class="flex gap-10">
<div>

```python
def combine_keys_and_values(keys, values):
    return dict(zip(keys, values))


def combine_keys_and_values_2(keys, values):
    return {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}

expected = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
got1 = combine_keys_and_values(["a", "b"], [1, 2])
got2 = combine_keys_and_values(["a", "b"], [1, 2])
```

</div>
<div>

- If you define good functions, their interface remains stable
- Can improve the implementation without worrying it will break things

</div>
</div>

# This works for any project!

<br/>

- Many scientists think they cannot use unit tests in their projects
- But any project can be decomposed into small steps for which you do know what they
should do
- Test the steps, not the whole

# What are testing frameworks


- In the above examples, python would abort after the first failed test
- Would be nicer to be able to:
  - run all tests and get a report in the end
  - quickly specify subsets of tests to run
  - run the same tests with multiple inputs
- Testing frameworks do just that
- Industry standard is pytest which is basically pytask for tests
