# Script: Naming things

## Naming is hard but important

- Finding good names is a defining difference between good and bad programmers
- A skill that is mostly language independent

## Who knows what happens here?

- Code has copyright "Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé and Martín Uribe, March 2014."
- Don't know which paper, it is something Mariam used to work on
- The code file is 295 lines long and it all looks like this!
- Highlight that the comments don't even make it that much better!

## General recommendations

- Abbreviations:
  - Say that the tradition of using abbreviations comes from Fortran 77 times with
    character limits
- Avoid misspelled words
  - There is one way to spell it right and many ways to spell it wrong!

## Variable names

- If you need type information, use type hints in modern Python

## Function names

- I had it often last year that people start every function name with `call`!
