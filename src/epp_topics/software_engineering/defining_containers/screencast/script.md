# Script: Defining custom containers

- This first screencast on the topic should focus on the mechanics of defining each data
  structure
- There are still a few important messages about usage:
  - Dicts are still awesome and should not always be replaced by custom data structures
  - NamedTuples vs. dataclasses is for now mainly a matter of personal taste

## Running example

- Want to record basic data of students in this course: First name, last name, email

## Some drawbacks of dictionaries

- This is just a motivation for custom data structures; Go over it as quickly as
  possible

## NamedTuples

Big difference:

- Dict keys are string literals
- NamedTuple fields are identifiers

## Reminder

- Mention that the next screencast will be about this
