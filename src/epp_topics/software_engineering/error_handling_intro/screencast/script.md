# Script: Why and where to raise errors

This screencast has the following goals

- Motivate why good error handling is important
- Show the running example
- Make them think about which errors to handle

I thought about splitting it and adding more details for each part but I can't possibly
make them watch more than three screencasts on error handling and I think they still
have a reasonable length.

## Motivation

- Possibly mention the extremely helpful error message we got when we needed
  `convert_categoricals=False`

## Example

- Mention that this will be the example for all screencasts on error handling
- I had to violate docstring conventions to get at least a minimal docstring for the
  public function on the slides
- They can take the data conversion function as given for now
