# Script: Testing code that should raise errors

## Introduction

Mention that we will scratch on the surface a couple of important ideas here

- Tests pin down the interface of a function / its desired behaviour
- Tests help you learn behaviour of programmes / libraries

## Run pytest, again

- Tests pass, all good?
- No, see why in the screencast on what and how to test
