### Line profiling

<br/>

Janoś Gabler and Hans-Martin von Gaudecker

## Summing up

- Line profiling is a bit harder to use than snakeviz.

- Benefit: Shows you exactly in which line the time is spent.

- Usual process:

  1. Find a slow function with snakeviz

  2. If not enough: Create a line-profile of it with `%lprun`.

- The more practice you get, the more you can learn from the output of profilers
