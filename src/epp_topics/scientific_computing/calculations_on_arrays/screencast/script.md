# Script: Calculations on arrays

## Vectorization

Mention that vectorization has two meanings and we will learn about the second meaning
in the speedup screencast.

Mention that on top of having the loops in a fast language, numpy functions contain more
optimizations that you would not get when writing a simple loop in C, Fortan, Julia,
...; That's why those languages also have array libraries
