# Examples of broadcasting

<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

```python
>>> a = np.zeros((2, 3), dtype=np.int64)
>>> a
array([[0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0]])

# element-wise addition
>>> a + 1
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [1, 1, 1]])

# row-wise addition
>>> a + np.array([1, 2, 3])
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [1, 2, 3]])

# column-wise addition
>>> a + np.array([[4], [5]])
array([[4, 4, 4],
       [5, 5, 5]])
```

</div>
<div>

<br/>
<br/>

- Arrays don't have to have identical shapes to do calculations between them
- Smaller arrays are broadcasted to the larger shape
- Shapes need to be compatible as defined by the broadcasting rules

</div>
</div>

# The broadcasting rule

<br/>

> Two arrays are compatible for broadcasting if for each *trailing dimension* (i.e.,
> starting from the end) the axis lengths match or if either of the lengths is 1.
> Broadcasting is then applied over the missing or length 1 dimensions

<br/>

# Detailed walk through examples

<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

```python
>>> a = np.zeros((2, 3), dtype=np.int64)

# row-wise addition
>>> b = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> b.shape
(3,)
>>> a + b
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [1, 2, 3]])

# column-wise addition
>>> c = np.array([[4], [5]])
>>> c.shape
(2, 1)
>>> a + c
array([[4, 4, 4],
       [5, 5, 5]])
```

</div>
<div>

<br/>
<br/>

- `a + b`: Axis 1 matches (3), axis 0 is broadcasted twice
- `a + c`: Axis 1 is has length 1, axis 0 matches (2), axis 1 is broadcasted three times
- More efficient than repeating arrays!

# Advanced example: Outer product


<div class="flex gap-12">
<div>

```python
>>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
>>> np.outer(a, b)
array([[ 4,  5,  6],
       [ 8, 10, 12],
       [12, 15, 18]])

>>> a.reshape(1, 3) * b.reshape(3, 1)
array([[ 4,  8, 12],
       [ 5, 10, 15],
       [ 6, 12, 18]])

>>> a * b.reshape(3, 1)
array([[ 4,  5,  6],
       [ 8, 10, 12],
       [12, 15, 18]])
```

</div>

- Here, broadcasting is used to calculate an outer product without using the `np.outer`
  function
- `a` is reshaped to a row vector
- `b` is reshaped to a column vector
- Broadcasting rules apply along both axes!
- `a` would be implicitly treated as a row vector, too.
