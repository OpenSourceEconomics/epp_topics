# Script: Creating arrays

Mention that creating arrays is very important for creating test inputs for functions

## Reshaping

- Don't say too much about row-major vs. column-major
- Mainly show the meaning of row major in the reshaping example

## Repeating arrays

- This slide is taken from deep-learning where repetition was introduced only after they
  had much more experience with arrays. Feel free to shorten or take it out completely.

- If you leave the reference to broadcasting in, mention that they will learn what that
  means later.
