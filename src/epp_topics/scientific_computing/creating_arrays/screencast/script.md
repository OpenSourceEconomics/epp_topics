# Script: Creating arrays

Mention that creating arrays is very important for creating test inputs for functions

## Constructors

- `np.ones_like(a, ...)` Return an array of ones with the same shape and type as a given
  array
- `np.full(shape, fill_value, ...)` Return a new array of given shape and type, filled
  with fill_value

## Reshaping

- Don't say too much about row-major vs. column-major
- Mainly show the meaning of row major in the reshaping example

## Repeating arrays

- Mention that broadcasting is a separate screencast.
