# Summary of Last Presentations

- `pip` and `PyPI` are the default package installer and repository for Python

- `pip` can only install Python packages

- A package may rely on non-Python dependencies, in which case

  - the pre-compiled dependencies are bundled with the Python source in a Python Wheel (e.g., linalg libraries in NumPy)

  - the user must install the dependencies manually (e.g., CUDA for JAX)

  - the source code is compiled during installation

âž¡ non-Python dependencies cannot be shared between packages and their versions are not
guaranteed to be compatible!


---

# Conda Channels

- A channel is a repository of packages (just like PyPI)

- Besides Python many languages can be supported (e.g., R, C++, Fortran, and more)

- There are many channels:

  - `defaults`: The default channel supported by Anaconda, Inc. (do not use!)

  - `conda-forge`: A community-driven channel with many packages (recommended)

  - `bioconda`: A channel for bioinformatics packages


---

# Pixi and Conda


- A package, dependency, and environment manager

- Can install all packages
- A unified way to install packages and manage separate environments


---

# The Anaconda Distribution

- A curated collection of packages maintained by Anaconda, Inc.

- Distributed with conda, Python, and many scientific libraries
- Often used in data science to quickly get a working setup


---

# The conda-forge Channel

- A community-driven collection of recipes for building packages

- Maintains a wide variety of packages and up-to-date versions
- Compatible with Anaconda and other conda installations


---

# Differences to pip and PyPI

- Conda can manage non-Python dependencies (e.g., compilers, system libraries)

- Conda-forge provides pre-compiled binaries for multiple platforms

- pip relies solely on Python wheels or source code from PyPI


---

# Example

Let's look at the packages in the environment when we

1. `pip install numpy`

1. `conda install numpy`


---

# Why This Matters

- Easier environment management: Reproducibility, isolation, and fewer conflicts

- Pre-compiled binaries: Faster, more reliable installations
- Community contributions: Quick updates and broader package availability
